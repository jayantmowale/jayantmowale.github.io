# MY PROJECTS
---

## Project 1:	[Line Sizing Project:] 
- *Designed simple piping network for transport of fluid from one tank to another* 
- *learnt general methodology to size pipes & used industry standards such as ASME 14E, ASME B36.10M, moody diagram, swamee&jain equation to create a calculation sheet in excel.*


## Project 2: [Heat Exchanger Design:]
-	*Designed a cooler (1-4 pass Shell & Tube Hx) to reduce temperature of ethylbenzene from 135 C to 40 C using cooling water at 30 C.*


## Project 3: [Use of LPG cylinders for medical oxygen during emergencies:]()
-	*Studied potential for usage of LPG cylinders for medical use during emergencies such as COVID 19 and using isothermal blowdown of tank analysis found that LPG cylinders can supply 0.5 L/min of oxygen for nearly 3 hours.*


## Project 4: [Packed Tower Design:]()
-	*Designed a Packed Bed Tower for scrubbing 10% SO2 in air using water and simulated it in DWSIM.*
